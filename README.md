# ViTAdapter TIMM

This project is an implementation of the Vision Transformer Adapter decribed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.08534)

I tried following the same standard as the TIMM implementation of the [Vision Transformer](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/blob/main/timm/models/vision_transformer.py).
Therfore the model integrates with the TIMM library and it can be used as any TIMM model, it can also be used as a TIMM backbone in the HuggingFace transformers library.
